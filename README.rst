Biological reasoning agents
===========================

A collection of agents for biological reasoning in a communication system. The following agents are currently available: 

- MRA (Mechanistic Reasoning Agent): The MRA uses INDRA to construct mechanistic models of biochemical systems from user input, publications and databases. It can also propose changes to model structure autonomously. 
- MEA (Model Execution Agent): The MEA sets up simulation conditions, simulates models and interprets the output.
- DTDA (Disease, Target and Drug Agent): The DTDA's task is to search for targets known to be implicated in a disease and to look for drugs that are known to affect that target.

We also provide a python implementation of a generic module in the TRIPS dialogue system and a python implementation of a KQML message dispatcher.
